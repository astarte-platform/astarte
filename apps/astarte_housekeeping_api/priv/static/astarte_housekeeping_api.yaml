          The base URL you're serving Astarte from. This should point to the base
          path from which Housekeeping API is served. In case you are running a local
          installation, this is likely `http://localhost:4001`. In case you have a
          standard Astarte installation, it is most likely
          `https://<your host>/housekeeping`.

    APIs for Administration activities such as Realm creation and Astarte
    configuration. This API is usually accessible only to system administrators,
    and is not meant for the average user of Astarte, which should refer to
    Realm Management API instead.

        Realm creation will be executed asynchronously by default - it is not
        guaranteed that the requested realm will be available as soon as the
        API call returns, but it is guaranteed that it will be eventually created
        if no errors are returned and Astarte is operating normally.
        You can perform the call synchronously by setting the async_operation query
        param to false.
