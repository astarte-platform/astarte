# ## SSL Support
#
# In order to use HTTPS in development, a self-signed
# certificate can be generated by running the following
# command from your terminal:
#
#     openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=US/ST=Denial/L=Springfield/O=Dis/CN=www.example.com" -keyout priv/server.key -out priv/server.pem
#
# The `http:` config above can be replaced with:
#
#     https: [port: 4000, keyfile: "priv/server.key", certfile: "priv/server.pem"],
#
# If desired, both `http:` and `https:` keys can be
# configured to run both http and https servers on
# different ports.
