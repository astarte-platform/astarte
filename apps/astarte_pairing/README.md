Astarte Pairing API
===================

Astarte device pairing service.

This Astarte platform component takes care of device pairing, that happens everytime a new device connects for the first time to Astarte or when an already connected device needs to renew its credentials.

The component offers a REST API which allows devices to get an API key and to renew SSL certificates.
