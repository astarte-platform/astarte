            Identifies the type of this Interface. Currently two types are
            supported: datastream and properties. datastream should be used when
            dealing with streams of non-persistent data, where a single path
            receives updates and there's no concept of state. properties,
            instead, are meant to be an actual state and as such they have only
            a change history, and are retained.
        ownership:
          type: string
          enum:
            - device

          description: >-
            Identifies the ownership of the interface. Interfaces are meant to
            be unidirectional, and this property defines who's sending or
            receiving data. device means the device/gateway is sending data to
            Astarte, server means the device/gateway is receiving data from
            Astarte. Bidirectional mode is not supported, you should instantiate
            another interface for that.
        aggregation:

          description: >-
            Identifies the aggregation of the mappings of the interface.
            Individual means every mapping changes state or streams data
            independently, whereas an object aggregation treats the interface as
            an object, making all the mappings changes interdependent. Choosing
            the right aggregation might drastically improve performances.

            Mappings define the endpoint of the interface, where actual data is
            stored/streamed. They are defined as relative URLs (e.g. /my/path)
            and can be parametrized (e.g.: /%{myparam}/path). A valid interface
            must have no mappings clash, which means that every mapping must
            resolve to a unique path or collection of paths (including
            parametrization). Every mapping acquires type, quality and
            aggregation of the interface.

            composed by all the mappings for one specific parameter combination.
            /timestamp is a reserved path for timestamps, so every mapping on a
            datastream must not have any endpoint that ends with /timestamp.

            Useful only with datastream. Defines whether the sent data should be
            considered delivered when the transport successfully sends the data
            (unreliable), when we know that the data has been received at least
            once (guaranteed) or when we know that the data has been received
            exactly once (unique). unreliable by default. When using reliable
            data, consider you might incur in additional resource usage on both
            the transport and the device's end.

            (discard) or should be kept in a cache in memory (volatile) or on
            disk (stored), and guaranteed to be delivered in the timeframe
            defined by the expiry. discard by default.
