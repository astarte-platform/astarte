          The base URL you're serving Astarte from. This should point to the base
          path from which AppEngine API is served. In case you are running a local
          installation, this is likely `http://localhost:4002`. If you are on a
          multi-domain instance, it is likely `https://appengine.api.<your host>/`.
          In case you have a single domain instance, it is most likely
          `https://<your host>/appengine`.

    Astarte's AppEngine API is the main entry point for any operations which have
    an impact on devices and their data. Most Astarte applications would want to
    use this API to interact with devices, stream and receive data, and oversee
    their fleet.
