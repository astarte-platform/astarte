# Manual Operator Installation

In case you do not want to use `astartectl` to manage the Operator, this guide will run you through
all the steps needed to set up Astarte Kubernetes without any external tool but `kubectl`.

*Note: Please be aware that this method is to be used only if you have very specific reasons why not to
use `astartectl`, for example: you're running a fork of the Operator, you're running the Operator
outside of the cluster, or you're on the very bleeding edge.
`astartectl` automates internally all of this guide and should be your main choice in production.*

## Clone the Operator Repository

First of all, you will need to clone the Operator repository, as this is where some of the needed resources
for the Operator are. Ensure you're cloning the right branch for the Operator Version you'd like to install.
For example, if you want to Deploy an Operator in the 0.11 series, you would

```
git clone -b master https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-kubernetes-operator.git
```

## Install RBACs and CRDs

The Operator requires a number of RBAC roles to run, and will also require Astarte CRDs to be installed.

Navigate into the `deploy` directory of your local clone, and install the service account:

```
kubectl apply -f service_account.yaml
kubectl get ServiceAccount -n kube-system astarte-operator
```

Then, install the Cluster Role

```
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
kubectl get ClusterRole astarte-operator
```

Last but not least, install the Cluster Role Binding:

```
kubectl apply -f role_binding.yaml
kubectl get ClusterRoleBinding astarte-operator
```

Once done, navigate into the `deploy/crds` directory of your local clone, and install all Astarte Custom
Resource Definitions:

```
kubectl create -f api.astarte-platform.org_astartes_crd.yaml
kubectl create -f api.astarte-platform.org_astartevoyageringresses_crd.yaml
kubectl get CustomResourceDefinition
```

### Caveats for Astarte CRDs

Astarte CRDs are automatically generated and embed the OpenAPIv3 schema of the Custom Resource. For this reason, they're
quite big in size. For this reason, using `kubectl apply` on these resources will always fail, as the annotations
generated by `kubectl` would be beyond Kubernetes' character limit for annotations.
To work around this, you should always install CRDs with `kubectl create` and update them with `kubectl replace`.

## Running the Operator inside the Cluster

Navigate into the `deploy` directory of your local clone. The Operator Deployment template can be found in
`operator.yaml`. At this time, you might want to tweak the Deployment - especially for what concerns the
image tag. Once you're ready to go, apply the Deployment to your Kubernetes cluster, and wait until it
becomes ready.

```
kubectl apply -f operator.yaml
kubectl get deployment -n kube-system astarte-operator
```

## Running the Operator outside the Cluster

*Note: Running the operator outside the cluster is not advised in production. Usually, you need such a deployment
if you plan on developing the Operator itself. However, this scenario is tested in the e2e tests, and as such
provides the very same features of the in-cluster Deployment, which remains the go-to scenario for production.*

To run the Operator outside the cluster, you will need the `operator-sdk` command line. Please refer to
[`operator-sdk` installation guide](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/install-operator-sdk.md)
to install it. Also, please make sure that the version of `operator-sdk` matches or is compatible with the version
of the `operator-sdk` module in the Operator's `go.mod` file.

Navigate to the root directory of your clone, and run

```
operator-sdk run --local
```

This will bring up the Operator and connect it to your current Kubernetes context.

### Caveats

When running the Operator locally, you're bound to a single namespace, and to all limitations of `operator-sdk run`. This is
out of the scope of this guide, and you should be confident with
[`operator-sdk`'s User Guide](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md) if you plan
on running the Operator outside the Cluster.
