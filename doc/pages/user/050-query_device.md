# Querying a Device

Once you have your devices connected, up and running in Astarte, you can start interacting with them.

## Device status

First things first, you can check if your device is correctly registered in Astarte, and its current status.
Let's assume our Device has `f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA` as its id.
A Device's status includes a number of useful information, among which whether it is connected or not to its Transport,
its introspection, the amount of exchanged data and more.

### Query Device status using astartectl

```bash
$ astartectl appengine devices show f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA
Device ID:                      f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA

```

### Query Device status using Astarte Dashboard

After logging in to Astarte dashboard, go to the "Devices" page clicking on the menu on your left. A list of
available Device IDs will appear. If you do not see your device at a glance, use the search bar on the top right
to find it.
Clicking on the Device ID will take you to its details page.

### Query Device status using AppEngine API

`GET <astarte base API URL>/appengine/v1/test/devices/f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA`

```json
{
    "data": {
        "total_received_msgs": 221,
        "total_received_bytes": 11660,
        "last_seen_ip": "203.0.113.89",
        "last_credentials_request_ip": "203.0.113.201",
        "last_disconnection": "2018-02-07T18:38:57.266Z",
        "last_connection": "2018-02-08T09:49:26.556Z",
        "id": "f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA",
        "first_registration": "2018-01-31T17:10:59.270Z",
        "connected": true,
        "introspection": {
            "com.example.ExampleInterface" : {
                "major" : 1,
                "minor" : 0,
                "exchanged_msgs": 20,
                "exchanged_bytes": 200
            },
            "org.example.TestInterface" : {
                "major" : 0,
                "minor" : 2,
                "exchanged_msgs": 8,
                "exchanged_bytes": 147
            }
        },
        "aliases": {
            "name": "device_a"
        },
        "attributes": {
            "attributes_key": "attributes_value"
        },
        "groups": [
            "my_group",
        ],
        "previous_interfaces": [
            {
                "name": "com.example.ExampleInterface",
                "major" : 0,
                "minor" : 2,
                "exchanged_msgs": 3,
                "exchanged_bytes": 120
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Through the API, it is also possible to get the Introspection of the device only:

`GET <astarte base API URL>/appengine/v1/test/devices/f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA/interfaces`

```json
{
    "data": [
        "com.example.ExampleInterface",
        "com.example.TestInterface"
    ]
}
```

This returns the Interfaces which the device reported in its Introspection *and* which are known to the Realm.

Arbitrary information can be added to the device by means of `attributes`: they allow to store any
number of string values associated to a corresponding string key.
To set, modify and delete `attributes`, a `PATCH` on the device endpoint is required:

```
PATCH <astarte base API URL>/appengine/v1/test/devices/f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

In the request body, the `data` JSON object should have a `attributes` key which bears a dictionary
of strings. A valid request body which changes only device attributes, for example, is
`{"data":{"attributes": {"<key>": "<value>"}}}`. To delete an attribute entry, set the value of the
corresponding key to `null`. For example, POSTing `{"data":{"attributes": {"my_key": null}}}` will
remove the `my_key` attribute entry from the device.

Depending on the aggregation and ownership of the Interface, you can `GET`/`PUT`/`POST` on the interface itself or one of its mappings,
or use `astartectl` to perform the same operation on the command line. Some examples are:

### Get data from an `aggregate` `device` `properties` interface

`astartectl` invocation: `astartectl appengine devices data-snapshot f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA com.example.ExampleInterface`

AppEngine API invocation: `GET <astarte base API URL>/appengine/v1/test/devices/f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA/interfaces/com.example.ExampleInterface`

### Get last sent value from an `individual` `device` `datastream` interface

`astartectl` invocation: `astartectl appengine devices data-snapshot f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA com.example.TestInterface`

AppEngine API invocation: `GET <astarte base API URL>/appengine/v1/test/devices/f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA/interfaces/com.example.TestInterface/myValue?limit=1`

### Set values in an `individual` `server` `datastream` interface

`astartectl` invocation: `astartectl appengine devices send-data f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA com.example.OtherTestInterface /myOtherValue <value>`

AppEngine API invocation: `POST <astarte base API URL>/appengine/v1/test/devices/f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA/interfaces/com.example.OtherTestInterface/myOtherValue`
Request body: `{"data": <value>}`

### API Query semantics

In general, to query AppEngine, the following things must be kept in mind

* When sending data, use `PUT` if dealing with `properties`, `POST` if dealing with `datastream`.
* When `GET`ting, if you are querying an `aggregate` interface, make sure to query the interface itself rather than its mappings.
* When `GET`ting `datastream`, keep in mind that AppEngine's default behavior is to return a large as possible timeseries.

## Navigating and retrieving Datastream results through APIs

The Datastream case is significant, as it might be common to have *a lot* of values for each endpoint/interface. As such, returning all of them in a single API call is most of the times not desirable nor recommended.

To avoid putting the cluster under excessive pressure, AppEngine API is configured with a hard cap on the maximum number of returned results for each single call, with a sane default of `10000`. Although this hard cap is entirely configurable, please be aware that AppEngine API is designed to process a lot of reasonably small requests in the shortest possible time, and hence is **not optimised nor strongly tested against big requests**. Make sure that AppEngine API has enough resources available to cope with the maximum dataset size.

AppEngine API provides you with a variety of mechanisms to make retrieval and navigation of large data sets as smooth and efficient as possible.

### Limit

Adding a `limit=n` to the URL query tells AppEngine to return no more than `n` results. This acts similarly to a `LIMIT` SQL statement, but, as it stands, it does not impose a hard limit on the whole retrieved dataset but on the amount of the results displayed by the API call - see [Pagination and Time Windows](#pagination-and-time-windows) for more details on this topic and the performance implications of different limits in queries.

If the specified `limit` is beyond the hard cap, the query won't fail, but will return at most the amount set by the hard cap, without further warnings.

### Since/To/Since After

Results can be limited to a specific time window. `since` and `to` can be set to a ISO 8601 valid timestamp to limit on an upper and lower bound the result set. This can also be combined with `limit` to make sure that no more than `n` results are returned. Also, `since` and `to` can as well be set independently to provide only an upper or lower bound.

In case you're dealing with a very large dataset and you want to dump it, it is likely that you need to go beyond what a reasonable default limit looks like. In those cases, you can use the `since_after` query parameter to retrieve parameters within a time window. `since_after` slices the time window just like `since` does, but it does not include values matching the specified timestamp, if any. This is especially useful when paginating, to start right after a returned result.

### Pagination and time windows

AppEngine API provides you automatically with a time window-based pagination. When `GET`ting a `datastream`, if more results are available beyond the chosen time window/limit, a `links` map will be provided, in JSON-API style, to allow the user to paginate the results accordingly using `since_after`.

You can use `limit` to determine each page's size. When specifying a valid `limit`, the `links` will keep the page size consistent over the next calls.

However, `limit` should be used wisely to lower the pressure on the cluster. Each API call maps to a query that, no matter how efficient, has a computational cost. A few mid-sized queries should **always** be preferred over a large amount of smaller queries. Given your cluster is configured correctly, `limit` should be omitted in most cases when paginating, and you should rather trust your cluster's hard cap to be the sweet spot in efficiency and cluster pressure.

### Downsampling

Especially when plotting graphs, retrieving all points in a time series isn't desirable. Astarte provides you with an implementation of the [LTTB Downsampling Algorithm](https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/15343/3/SS_MSthesis.pdf), which is used to return only a fixed number of samples from a time series. When setting `downsample_to=n`, AppEngine will return a maximum of `n` results, which are the most significant over the considered time series according to the algorithm.

Due to how LTTB works, `downsample_to` **must** be `>2`, as the algorithm will return the two ends of the considered value bucket, and `n-2` values which are the picked samples. Please refer to the [LTTB implementation used by Astarte](https://github.com/ispirata/ex_lttb) to learn more about how this algorithm affects samples and its limitations.

`downsample_to=x` can be used in conjunction with other query parameters, including `limit=y`. When doing so, Astarte will downsample to `x` samples the dataset composed of the last `y` values. Every feature previously outlined is in fact available with downsampling, including pagination - bear in mind, though, that for how the algorithm works, some options have drastically different semantic effects.

Also, the hard cap has a very different meaning in downsampling. In this case, the hard cap applies to `downsample_to` instead of `limit`. `limit` can be an arbitrarly large amount of samples taken out of the DB, and can be used mainly to alleviate pressure in case of *extremely* large datasets which would require a lot of time for being processed by LTTB - even though, most of the time, you might want to define a time window to downsample instead.

Astarte is also capable of downsampling aggregated interfaces, as long as a `downsample_key` is specified, which has to match the last token of an `endpoint` of the queried `interface` (i.e. in case the interface has a `/%{id}/myValue` mapping which should be used as the `downsample_key`, you should specify `downsample_key=myValue` in the query). When doing so, the aggregate will be downsampled using the chosen `endpoint` value as the `y` axis value, whereas its other `endpoints` will be disregarded when applying the algorithm. Please note that, no matter what `downsample_key` is used, a sample will be composed by the whole aggregation.

If there is no way an interface can be downsampled (this is true, for example, if no `downsample_key` has been specified for `aggregations`, or for types such as `strings`), AppEngine API will return a `4xx` error. In general, downsampling is a powerful mechanism with a lot of limitations which really shines when plotting. Once again, this is a fundamental factor to consider when [designing your interfaces](029-interface_design_guide.html).

## Real-Time Updates

The http REST API returns a static result, therefore API clients should either poll the REST API when displaying real-time changes or use a WebSocket.
WebSockets are called [Astarte Channels](052-using_channels.md) in Astarte jargon, and they should be considered as a more efficient alternative to polling.
When [using Astarte Channels](052-using_channels.md) the REST API should be used to retrieve the initial status.

## astartectl-specific features

`astartectl` implements some convenience methods that make navigation easier. In particular, `astartectl` allows for any of the AppEngine API query parameters/mechanisms, but also implements automated pagination, snapshots and more.

### Data Snapshot

`astartectl` has a unique feature that allows to retrieve a "Data Snapshot" of a device, namely the last known value for every interface available in the Device's introspection. This is extremely useful to have an at-a-glance view of the Device status with regards to data. Simply invoke `astartectl appengine devices data-snapshot <device ID>`, or `astartectl appengine devices data-snapshot <device ID> <interface name>` to get a snapshot for a single interface.

### Advanced querying

`astartectl appengine devices get-samples` is `astartectl`'s frontend to advanced query. Refer to the command line documentation to learn about all available parameters, which match all of the parameters found in AppEngine API. The main difference is that, in case a query would break the boundaries of the page limit, `astartectl` will automatically paginate the request, and return all of the samples.

### Exporting Devices Data with astartectl

The previous feature makes `astartectl` extremely useful when it comes to export or dump data. Moreover, `get-samples` features a `--output` option, which allows to print the results in different formats, such as `json` or `CSV`. This way, exporting values becomes extremely easy, as `get-samples` can easily tap into an Interface's entire data set and print it into a CSV file.
