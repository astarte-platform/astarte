# Development Guide

Welcome to Astarte! To learn more about contributing to the [Astarte project](https://www.github.com/astarte-platform/astarte), check out the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This guide is focused on writing and testing changes to Astarte. It assumes basic knowledge in the following areas:

- You have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the project
- You are familiar with basic Astarte concepts such as Realms, Interfaces, Devices and Triggers. If you are not, you can learn more on the [documentation](001-intro_architecture.md)!
- You have already run at least once [Astarte in 5 minutes](010-astarte_in_5_minutes.md)
- If you plan to work on the code, you have some knowledge of Elixir and Docker

## Where to start?

To make your contribution, let's first identify where to do it.

### Code

In general, you will probably touch one of the Astarte components.
Astarte is made up of a number of different microservices: [here](020-components.html) you can find a quick summary of each.

Moreover, components that expose an API (Housekeeping, Pairing, Realm Management) are split in an API service and a backend one. All of those are located in the [main Astarte repository](https://www.github.com/astarte-platform/astarte) on Github, in the `apps` directory.

Finally, Astarte is backed by three libraries:

- [Astarte Core](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte_core): contains definitions common to the application, e.g. Realm name, Device ID validity, Interface definitions etc.
- [Astarte RPC](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte_rpc): contains all the Protobufs and code used in the internal RPC mechanism. In most cases, RPCs are between an API component and the related backend.
- [Astarte Data Access](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte_data_access): contains some interactions with the database that are common to all Astarte services, e.g. queries for interface values.

### Documentation

Documentation is automatically generated from files in the `doc/pages` subdirectory of the [main Astarte repository](https://www.github.com/astarte-platform/astarte) on Github.
It is written in Github-flavored markdown.

### Tooling

The main Astarte repo contains a number of tools that can be used everyday when interacting with Astarte. They are found in the `tools` directory subdirectory of the [main Astarte repository](https://www.github.com/astarte-platform/astarte) on Github:

- Astarte Device Fleet Simulator: create a fleet of virtual devices. Mainly used for load testing
- Astarte E2E: a tool that sends data from a virtual device and checks the resulting value in Astarte using triggers. Mainly used for monitoring
- Astarte Import and Astarte Export: used to load/export data into/from Astarte

## Setting up Elixir
In order to install and manage Elixir (and Erlang), we recommend using either the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) runtime version manager or the [nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager.

### Using asdf

From inside the main Astarte directory, install the Elixir and Erlang asdf plugins
```bash
asdf plugin add erlang
asdf plugin add elixir
```

Then install Elang/OTP and Elixir with
```bash
asdf install
```

### Using nix

From inside the main Astarte directory, just run
- `nix develop`, if you are using flakes
- `nix-shell`, if not

## Can I use an Elixir REPL to help me during development?

Sure thing! However, usually Astarte services do need some context around them.
Refer to the following ["Testing a single component"](#testing-a-single-component) paragraph for dependencies, then you can start your application with an interactive shell by replacing `mix test` with `iex -S mix`

## Ok, I made changes, what now?

Once you got your hands dirty, is time to test them.
You can test changes to a single component, or run E2E tests if more than one service is involved.

Remember that a contribution should always include tests for the new functionality or the fix.
We use the [ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.html) framework for unit testing.
Work is under way to add property-based testing too! 

### Testing a single component

In general, you will have to bring up a RabbitMQ and a Scylla instance (not all services need both: API services will not need access to the database).
You can do so by running

```bash
docker run --rm -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:management
docker run --rm -p 9042:9042 scylladb/scylla
```

Then, you can run test in the component directory with

```bash
RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost CASSANDRA_NODES=localhost mix test --exclude wip
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some services are a bit special (for now!) and might need a little more setup for testing.
> - AppEngine API needs the AMQP exchange `astarte_events` to be declared:
> after having started RabbitMQ, run the following lines to declare it:
>  ```bash
>   docker exec $RABBITMQ_CONTAINER_NAME rabbitmqadmin declare exchange name=astarte_events type=direct
>  ```

> - Pairing needs a CFSSL instance available and exposed on port 8080: you can run
>  ```bash
>  docker run --net=host -p 8080/tcp ispirata/docker-alpine-cfssl-autotest:astarte
>  ```
> 
> and then test using
>  ```bash
>  RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost CASSANDRA_NODES=localhost CFSSL_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 mix test --exclude wip
>  ```

### E2E testing

docker compose is the quick-and-dirty way to spin up a development instance of Astarte.
You can do so just by running `docker compose up -d` in the main Astarte directory.
You can rebuild the service you’re working on with `docker compose build $SERVICE_NAME`,
or edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to change the service image name.
The first time you're running Astarte, you will have to run
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/compose:/compose astarte/docker-compose-initializer:snapshot
```

in order to set up the Housekeeping keypair, the devices root CA and a certificate for the broker.

Then, you can use the following commands to manage Astarte services:
- `docker compose up -d` starts all containers in detached mode
- `docker compose down $SERVICE_NAME -v` stops and cleans the service you’re working on
- `docker compose up $SERVICE_NAME --build` rebuilds the service and restarts it. If you don’t need to tail logs, you may add `-d`

## Useful commands

Now, some commands you might find helpful to set up a realm:

- Create a realm keypair:
`astartectl utils gen-keypair $REALM_NAME`
- Create a Realm:
`astartectl housekeeping realms create $REALM_NAME -u http://api.astarte.localhost --housekeeping-key ./compose/astarte-keys/housekeeping_private.pem --realm-private-key $REALM_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`
- Install a list of Interfaces in a Realm:
`astartectl realm-management interfaces sync $(find $INTERFACE_DIRECTORY -name '*.json') -u http://api.astarte.localhost -r $REALM_NAME -k $REALM_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`
- Create a JWT wth claims on AppEngine, Pairing and RealmManagement APIs:
`astartectl utils gen-jwt all-realm-apis -k $REALM_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`
- Start a virtual device:
`docker run --net="host" -e "DEVICE_ID=$(astartectl utils device-id generate-random)" -e "PAIRING_URL=http://api.astarte.localhost/pairing" -e "REALM=$REALM_NAME" -e "PAIRING_JWT=$(astartectl utils gen-jwt pairing -k $REALM_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE)" -e "IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS=true" astarte/astarte-stream-qt5-test:1.0.4`
    - In this case, two interfaces need to be already installed in your realm: `org.astarte-platform.genericsensors.Values` and `org.astarte-platform.genericcommands.ServerCommands`
    - You can find them in the `standard-interfaces` directory in the Astarte repo

### Sending data from Astarte to a device

Using `astartectl` you can send messages to a device. For example:

- Publish a (server-owned) datastream:
`astartectl appengine devices publish-datastream $DEVICE_ID $SERVER_OWNED_DATASTREAM_INTERFACE $PATH $VALUE -r $REALM_NAME -k $REALM_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE -u "http://api.astarte.localhost/"`
- Set a (server-owned) property:
`astartectl appengine devices set-property $DEVICE_ID $SERVER_OWNED_PROPERTY_INTERFACE $PATH $VALUE -r $REALM_NAME -k $REALM_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE -u "http://api.astarte.localhost/"`

## Virtual devices

If you want to have more flexibility with a virtual device, you can use an SDK (https://docs.astarte-platform.org/device-sdks/index.html).

To register a device, use the Astarte Dashboard at `http://dashboard.astarte.localhost/` and create a device.
Save the Device ID and the Credentials Secret for the device, and use them for connecting to Astarte.

### Example: using the Elixir SDK

Assuming you have a valid Device ID and the related Credentials Secret, you can use the [Astarte Device Elixir SDK](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-device-sdk-elixir) to connect a virtual device.

Clone the project, move inside the directory and start a iEx shell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-device-sdk-elixir.git
cd astarte-device-sdk-elixir
iex -S mix
```

Now you can use the following commands to connect to Astarte:

```elixir
# Options to configure the device. <THESE> are placeholders for actual values.
opts = [pairing_url: "http://api.astarte.localhost/pairing", realm: "<YOUR_REALM>", device_id: "<YOUR_DEVICE_ID>", interface_provider: "<YOUR_INTERFACES_DIRECTORY>", credentials_secret: "<YOUR_CREDENTIALS_SECRET>", ignore_ssl_errors: true]

# Start the virtual device
{:ok, pid} = Astarte.Device.start_link(opts)

# Send a (device-owned) datastream
Astarte.Device.send_datastream(pid, "<A_DEVICE_OWNED_DATASTREAM_INTERFACE>", "<A_PATH>", <A_VALUE>)

# Set a (device-owned) property
Astarte.Device.set_property(pid, "<A_DEVICE_OWNED_PROPERTY_INTERFACE>", "<A_PATH>", <A_VALUE>)
```
