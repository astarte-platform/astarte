# Upgrade v1.0.0-v1.0.x

The current section describes the required steps to upgrade your Astarte instance from `v1.0.0` to
`v1.0.x`. Currently, the last released patch version is `v1.0.3` and, as such, the remainder of this
page will refer to this version. The described upgrade path involves some heavy changes as a
consequence of [this Voyager announcement](https://blog.byte.builders/post/voyager-v2021.09.15/) and
the following [Astarte design choice](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte/issues/613).

Before moving on, it must be clear that AstarteVoyagerIngress is deprecated and that **the only
supported managed ingress is the AstarteDefaultIngress** .

The upcoming sections will cover the following topics:
- upgrading the Astarte Operator,
- upgrading the Astarte instance to allow for TLS termination at VerneMQ level,
- deployment of the [`AstarteDefaultIngress`](064-setup_astartedefaultingress.html) in place of the
  deprecated `AstarteVoyagerIngress`.

Before starting with the upgrade procedure it is strongly advised to [backup your Astarte
resources](095-advanced-operations.html#backup-your-astarte-resources).

## Upgrade Astarte Operator

Astarte Operator's upgrade procedure is handled by Helm. However, according to the Helm policies,
upgrading the CRDs must be handled manually.

The current section assumes that the Operator's chart landing version is `v1.0.3`. If a more recent
chart version is available, it is **your responsibility** referencing to the `v1.0.3` chart using
the `--version` flag when running `helm` commands.

To upgrade the Astarte CRDs, the following environment variables will be employed:

- `ASTARTE_OP_TEMPLATE_DIR` is the target directory in which the chart templates will be generated,
- `ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAME` is the name of the Astarte Operator deployment,
- `ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAMESPACE` is the namespace in which the Astarte Operator resides.

Please, make sure that the values you set for both the Operator's name and namespace match the
naming you already adopted when installing the Operator. A wrong naming can lead to a malfunctioning
Astarte cluster.

For standard deployments the following variables should be ok. However, it is your responsibility
checking that the values you set are consistent with your setup:

```bash
export ASTARTE_OP_TEMPLATE_DIR=/tmp
export ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAME=astarte-operator
export ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAMESPACE=kube-system
```

Update your local Helm charts:
```bash
$ helm repo update
```

Render the Helm templates with the following:
```bash
helm template $ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAME astarte/astarte-operator \
    --namespace $ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAMESPACE \
    --output-dir $ASTARTE_OP_TEMPLATE_DIR
```

After these steps you will find the updated CRDs within
`$ASTARTE_OP_TEMPLATE_DIR/$ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAME/templates/crds.yaml`. Update the CRDs in your
cluster by replacing the CRDs yaml file:
```bash
kubectl replace -f $ASTARTE_OP_TEMPLATE_DIR/$ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAME/templates/crds.yaml
```

The previous command will raise an error saying `customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io
"astartedefaultingresses.ingress.astarte-platform.org" not found`. It is nothing to worry about:
under the hood the `replace` command has updated the CRDs for Astarte, AstarteVoyagerIngress and
Flow, while it cannot replace the `AstarteDefaultIngress` CRD as it is not installed yet. This issue
is easily fixed with the next command.

To upgrade the Operator use the dedicated `helm upgrade` command:
```bash
helm upgrade astarte-operator astarte/astarte-operator -n kube-system
```

The optional `--version` switch allows to specify the version to upgrade to - when not specified,
the latest version will be fetched and used. If you choose to upgrade to a specific version of the
chart by using the `--version` flag, please make sure to generate the updated CRDs template using
the same chart version.

By design, Astarte Operator's Helm charts cannot univocally be mapped to Operator's releases in a
one-to-one relationship. However each chart is tied to a specific Operator's version, which is user
configurable.

Therefore, upgrading a chart leads to an Operator's upgrade if and only if the Operator's tag
referenced by the chart is changed. You can check the Operator's tag bound to the chart simply
running:

```bash
helm show values astarte/astarte-operator
```

As usual, you can use the usual `--version` flag to point to a specific chart version.

## Upgrade Astarte

To upgrade your Astarte instance simply edit the Astarte resource in the cluster updating the
`version` field to the one you want to upgrade to.

In order to properly expose your Astarte instance to the outer world through the
[`AstarteDefaultIngress`](064-setup_astartedefaultingress.html) a configuration change for VerneMQ
is required: in particular, TLS termination must be handled at VerneMQ level.

Open the yaml file describing the Astarte resource with:
```bash
kubectl edit astarte -n astarte
```

Find the `version` field in the Astarte Spec section and change it according to your needs (i.e.:
set it to `1.0.3`). Moreover, in the `vernemq` configuration section two new fields must be added,
namely `sslListener` and `sslListenerCertSecretName`: the first field is a boolean that, when true,
set VerneMQ to handle TLS termination, while the latter set the secret containing the TLS
certificate (further details on certificates can be found [here](050-handling_certificates.html)).

To summarize, the needed changes will look like the following sample snippet:
```yaml
apiVersion: api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2
kind: Astarte
...
spec:
  ...
  vernemq:
    sslListener: true
    sslListenerCertSecretName: <your-tls-secret-name>
    ...
  version: 1.0.3
```

Once the yaml file is applied, the Operator will take over ensuring the reconciliation of your
Astarte instance.

### Caveats for Astarte Flow

Currently, although [Astarte Flow](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/flow/) is a component of
Astarte, it doesn't follow Astarte's release cycle. Therefore if you upgraded your Astarte instance
to v1.0.3, Astarte Operator will try to deploy `astarte/astarte_flow:1.0.3` which is currently not
existent.

All you have to do to overcome this temporary limitation is to edit your Astarte resource by
explicitly setting the Astarte Flow image you plan to use:
```yaml
spec:
  ...
  components:
    ...
    flow:
      image: <the-astarte-flow-image>
```

All the available Astarte Flow's tags can be found
[here](https://hub.docker.com/r/astarte/astarte_flow/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).

## Deploy `AstarteDefaultIngress` in place of `AstarteVoyagerIngress`

The current section describes the procedure for replacing the deprecated `AstarteVoyagerIngress`
with the new `AstarteDefaultIngress`. If the Voyager ingress is not deployed within your cluster,
feel free to skip this section.

The advised migration path involves the employment of `astartectl`: this is the most straightforward
way of performing the migration task and, as soon as all the requirements are satisfied, it requires
the execution of one single command.

The [Migrating to the AstarteDefaultIngress](066-migrate_to_astartedefaultingress.html) page
extensively cover this topic.
