# AstarteE2E

AstarteE2E is employed as a monitoring tool with the following functions:

- Astarte Device Simulation: AstarteE2E is responsible for simulating an Astarte device, allowing it to register with the Astarte system and stream data.

- Astarte Client Functionality: AstarteE2E also acts as an Astarte client that can receive data through triggers from the Astarte system.

- Data Consistency: The primary objective of AstarteE2E is to compare the data sent by the virtual device it simulates with the data received through triggers. This comparison helps determine the consistency of data.

- Cluster Status Evaluation: If the data received via triggers matches the data sent by the virtual device, it is considered an indicator that the cluster's status is in good condition.

- Error Notification: AstarteE2E has the capability to detect and respond to errors, such as device disconnections or other issues within the Astarte system. In the event of an error, AstarteE2E can send notifications to a designated audience via email. This serves as an alert mechanism, allowing relevant individuals to become aware of potential issues with the Astarte system.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `astarte_e2e` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:astarte_e2e, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/astarte_e2e](https://hexdocs.pm/astarte_e2e).

## Astarte Interfaces

### You'll need to install these two interfaces before running Astarte E2E.
